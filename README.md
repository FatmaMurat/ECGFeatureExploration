Exploring Deep Features and ECG Attributes to Detect Cardiac Rhythm Classes
---
Arrhythmia is a condition characterized by perturbation of the regular rhythm of the heart. In this study, an electrocardiogram (ECG) dataset containing more than 10,000 subject records was used to train and diagnose arrhythmia.  Experiments were conducted using denoised Lead-II ECG signals from the dataset. For evaluation of the various classifiers, we used the following: (i) clinical ECG features; (ii) features obtained from convolutional layers of a deep neural network model; and (iii) a combination of the above, which we termed fused features. Promising results were achieved using fused features and shallow classifiers. The random forest (RF) classifier yielded a patient-level arrhythmia classification accuracy of 98% Â± 0.64 using the fused features. The performance of shallow classifiers increased in parallel as the weights of the proposed DNN network adjusted. DNN models are an effective method of extracting distinctive features, and this study provides an exciting insight into the usefulness of features derived from deep learning model hierarchical layers. Additionally, it gives information about the change in the distinctiveness of feature maps created in different layers during training of deep learning models. Moreover, it allows for meaningful use of deep feature maps for shallow classifiers. The proposed architecture can assist clinicians in their daily routine to screen for arrhythmia.
